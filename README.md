# Catman
I had a pet, actually a great friend, her name was Erica, a female Mountain Lion, a cougar. I was not the person who raised her. she passed away from old age as did Erica. but the years we spent together was amazing, she loved kids, tame as any domesticated kittycat, She was meber an animal, she was an amazing sprit, The day we met we just seemed to hit off, Erica could never of been released back into the wild, she ate can and dry cougar chow, no joke, Purina makes a verity of chow for exotic family members, Cougar Chow, so Erica never hunted down pray, she never killed anything, hissed at a few dogs that were freaking out, that sent them running., Erica walked on a leash, not to her collar but a cheats harness. People are so afraid of big cats because of the stories you hear of one attacking a human, it happens, their natural habitat gets smaller and smaller as humans decide to live in their country, starving to death , so sad, yes they will attack pray that is not normal ,this is not the cats fault, a majority of humans are arrogantly stupid, personally I believe if there was ever an animal it its a human Oh That is how I got the nickname CATMAN.
